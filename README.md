# Weather-Tracker-Application
This project implements a multi-threaded Weather Tracker application that retrieves weather data from an external API and presents it in a user-friendly GUI. Utilizing ImGui for the interface, users can enter city names, view current weather conditions, and manage data with options to add or remove cities for enhanced real-time visualization.
